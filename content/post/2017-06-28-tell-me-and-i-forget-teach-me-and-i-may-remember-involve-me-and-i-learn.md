Often we do a 'group QA' session to validate the quality of [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/); we have [QA scripts](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/master/contrib-notes/release-process/weekly-qa-validation.md) that we follow but also this gives the opportunity do some freestyle testing. This gives the opportunity to use the code for real, and also allows people to learn about parts of the product they haven't worked on recently.

This is good - but sometimes you can get staid, and just follow the same routes too mechanically. Are we really testing the code or just looking at the minor niggles too much 'really should add an extra pixel to that image'. Plus as the complexity and usage of the product grows, how many simple 'hello world' scenarios can you really write that are useful?

This week we did something different. An internal Hackathon based on [tracking Airline parts](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/wiki/Hackathon-Exercise---Planes-and-Parts). This allowed us more time to get into a scenario learn some features that many of us had not worked on (or honestly forgotten about). And also to really use the code as other users will do.

We had two hours starting from the idea above to produce something - it's impressive what was done in two hours.
