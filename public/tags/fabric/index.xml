      <description>The Problem: with IBM Blockchain Platform running in a Kubernetes cluster how do you get the logs to find out what happened with your contract?
Setup This is command line stuff, so make sure that you have the kubectl command installed and it&amp;rsquo;s able to access the K8S Cluster. Or alternatively use the &amp;lsquo;web cli&amp;rsquo;.. your choice. Access either from the &amp;lsquo;Actions&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; menu on the cluster summary page.
The steps What is the k8s namespace?</description>

      <description>I had several docker containers spun up, all happily talking to each other on their own network. All happy for me to talk to them from the host Ubuntu system as well. Slight issue of when a configuration is exported from one of the docker containers, it was referring to the others by the domain it knew, example.com - not so great to use it from the host that knew it via localhost.</description>
