      <description>Supply chains are one great usecase for Blockchain and DLT; tracing coffee beans to be able to assert the provence of their origin is just one example.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a very bad pun to bridge to Java (the language).
Being a long time Java Developer (Java 1.1.3 anybody?) I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to be able to write this short guide to using Java with the Fabric Smart Contract programming model. The updated programming model was first delivered within Hyperledger Fabric in Node.</description>

      <description>Using Docker to help access Composer Cloud Wallets Within a cloud application, eg a nodejs app pushed to Cloud Foundary (other clouds are available) to access a Composer Smart Contract running on Hyperledger Fabric,
then you need the ability to store the network cards in some location that&amp;rsquo;s not your laptop.
Using the &amp;lsquo;Cloud wallets&amp;rsquo; feature it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to do this. You have the choice of S3, IBM Cloud Object Store, Cloudant, REDIS etc.</description>

      <description>“Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”
Benjamin_Franklin
 Often we do a &amp;lsquo;group QA&amp;rsquo; session to validate the quality of Hyperledger Composer; we have QA scripts that we follow but also this gives the opportunity do some freestyle testing. This gives the opportunity to use the code for real, and also allows people to learn about parts of the product they haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on recently.</description>
