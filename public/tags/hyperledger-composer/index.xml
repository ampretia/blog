      <description>Hyperledger Composer - Logging Many years ago there was an insect that caught in a relay. Time has moved on, but the successor to that insect still can make itself known! Logging though is more than about just finding the diagnostics to help squash the specific code bugs. It can be used to see operational performance issues, spot configuration mistakes, and gaining confidence in how the code is working.
How does Hyperledger Composer go about it&amp;rsquo;s logging then?</description>

      <description>Using Docker to help access Composer Cloud Wallets Within a cloud application, eg a nodejs app pushed to Cloud Foundary (other clouds are available) to access a Composer Smart Contract running on Hyperledger Fabric,
then you need the ability to store the network cards in some location that&amp;rsquo;s not your laptop.
Using the &amp;lsquo;Cloud wallets&amp;rsquo; feature it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to do this. You have the choice of S3, IBM Cloud Object Store, Cloudant, REDIS etc.</description>

Benjamin_Franklin
 Often we do a &amp;lsquo;group QA&amp;rsquo; session to validate the quality of Hyperledger Composer; we have QA scripts that we follow but also this gives the opportunity do some freestyle testing. This gives the opportunity to use the code for real, and also allows people to learn about parts of the product they haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on recently.</description>
